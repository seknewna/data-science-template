    "## Estimating Chichewa Speakers\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "This notebook provides statistics about the language of **Chichewa**. \n",
    "More specifically, the goal is to generate an accurate estimate of total number of people who speak this language. Note that Chichewa also includes the alternate names: *Chewa*, *Nyanja*, *Chinyanja*. In order to provide context, first, let us indicate the countries where the language is spoken. \n",
    "1. **Malawi.** About 70% of the population speak Chichewa. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "2. **Zambia.** About 20% of the population speak the language. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "3. **Mozamabique.** Less than 1% of the population speak the language. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "4. **Zimbabwe.** Although Chichewa seem to be one of the official languages for Zimbabwe, I havent found any data yet showing how many people speak the language.\n",
    "5. **Tanzania.** Has a border with Malawi in the northen region where people speak Tumbuka, so it makes sense that there maybe no Chichewa speaking people there. Otherwise, I didnot find any data on proportion of the population who speak the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis in this notebook, as of 2023, there are **21,482,292** people who speak Chichewa distributed across three countries: Malawi (70%), Zambia (18%) and Mozambique(12%).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Humanitarian data website](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/) contains data about languages for some of these countries. The HUMDATA links are provided below:\n",
    "- [Zambia languages](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/zambia-languages)\n",
    "- [Malawi languages](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/malawi-languages)\n",
    "- [Mozambique languages](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/mozambique-languages)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I was not very sure of some of the numbers from [humdata](https://data.humdata.org), I decided to check with the actual sources as follows:\n",
    ">**Malawi and Zambia.** I could not find any current surveys with data on languages spoken but I still found something in the DHS. In the DHS, they ask about survey respondent's native language. Although this data is not included in DHS reports (as they seem to collect this piece of data as interview metadata), its still a useful source of data for languages spoken. For *Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Mozambique* the DHS does'nt have this information as they only provide languages as language-1, language-2 etc except for the major languages.\n",
